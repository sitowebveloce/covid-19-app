# COVID-19 World Contagion APP

![COVID-19](/public/reactFront/img/covid19.gif)

Simple app to see the corona virus world spread situation constantly updated.
On top you can see the first country max deaths.

I just added a simple loader effect, and a chart data visualization 
of the infection using d3.
I changed the data order, now are ordered by country max deaths.

The project is realized using this tech:
- BackEnd NodeJ
- FrontEnd React Hooks
- Data visualization d3


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
